- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @actually-autistic, and I am, you guessed it, autistic.

This manual is designed for people I work with to understand how to help create the ideal conditions for getting our best work done as a team.

My style
- I am hard-wired to follow the established rules and structures, but I am open to challenging the status quo. If something needs to change, I‚Äôm happy to discuss it.
- I am most energised when I‚Äôm connecting dots/people/resources that translate challenges into opportunities. I‚Äôm a very direct person that prefers to enable people to solve their own problems, rather than solving them directly.
- I am always scanning for information to feed ideas in my mind, and typically do my best thinking out loud, with someone to bounce ideas off.
- My high expectations are matched by my commitment to support people in meeting those expectations. I believe in giving people freedom, flexibility and ‚Äústretch‚Äù assignments (tasks that will challenge your abilities), and equipping them with the tools they need to uncover and develop their potential.
- I'm very hands-off and expect you to do your job and act independently. However, if over time it's clear that you need more direction and oversight, then you can expect me to be there.
- If you need support emotionally, I am happy to listen, but I struggle to empathise. I am very solution-driven, so I can help you solve your problem, but it‚Äôs unlikely that I‚Äôll be able to make you feel better about it.
- I love to solve problems, remove barriers, and help others move the ball forward.  Don‚Äôt come to me with just a problem; you also need to bring plausible solutions and your recommended course of action. It‚Äôs not my job to solve your problems, it‚Äôs my job to help you solve your problems.
- I believe in tactical and strategic self-care‚Äîwhether sleeping enough, leaving work early to exercise, meditating, or spending time in nature. It is the key ingredient to becoming our best, most productive, and happy selves. If you‚Äôre not happy at work, or even at home, I want to know what we can do to solve that.

What I value
- I value honesty, initiative, integrity, and forthrightness. Be smart, trustworthy, think of creative solutions, and don‚Äôt be afraid to speak up, especially if it‚Äôs to admit a mistake, or admit failure. 
- I‚Äôm obsessed with managing my work and time, and I aim to eliminate any possibility of error when it comes to projects or initiatives.
- I also expect my teammates to value efficiency, and efficient communication. Before doing something, look for an easier, cheaper, simpler way to maximize your ‚Äúreturn on effort‚Äù. Before starting something from scratch, ask if it‚Äôs already been tried. Work smarter, not harder.
- I value results. If you‚Äôve made a commitment, then get it done. If you are having problems or doubts with this mid-project, it's better to let me know beforehand so we can adapt.

What I don‚Äôt have patience for
- If you make a mistake or something is heading off the rails, tell me before the crash. Failure is acceptable; surprises are not. If there is a problem, I want a chance to solve it, before it impacts others.
- Don‚Äôt use ‚Äòbusiness speak‚Äô when we‚Äôre having a private discussion. Trying to read between the lines is a frustrating exercise for me, and draws out the conversation unnecessarily.
- I default to trust, but if my confidence is shaken, it‚Äôs hard to rebuild. Meet your commitments, push important information to me, don‚Äôt avoid hard conversations, and treat others with respect. If you stick to that, we‚Äôll get along fine.
- Excuses, and preventable failure. An excuse is an unfounded reason for why something was not accomplished, and explanation is telling the honest story of why something was not achieved. If you haven‚Äôt tried everything to achieve your goal, including speaking to me, then you don‚Äôt have an explanation for failure; you have an excuse.
- I don‚Äôt like to use my time poorly. I‚Äôd prefer to work on initiatives that provide the most value. I adhere to the Pareto Principle; 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes.
- I don‚Äôt like being drip-fed information, or guided to an answer. Be direct in our communication. Just tell me what your goal is, so we can address it.
- Challenging thoughts, opinions, plans or ideas is encouraged, as long as you can give me a good reason or evidence as to why you‚Äôre challenging them. Challenging something without an alternative solution makes you part of the problem. Your thoughts and ideas should come with conviction and intent, not just to be contrary.

How best to communicate with me
- Be succinct. I need to know your main point from the get-go. If you delay and instead try to build up to your main point, then I tend to become impatient and annoyed. Do not leave a single detail out - I cannot make an informed decision without all of the information. If I don't get all of the details, I'll ask for more. Come prepared with everything I need.
- I have a laser focus on what I'm working on at the moment. If you overload me with information when I‚Äôm not prepared, I will push back on you, or put your task to the back of the line until I feel comfortable enough to process it. 
- In person, say my name and then give me a few seconds to respond, so I can shift my attention from my current focus. Online, wait for me to reply back and engage you, before presenting me with your information.
- If you are struggling to communicate with me online, pick up the phone and give me a call. I struggle with text based communication, because I miss the social cues that help me understand what you‚Äôre trying to get across to me.
- Try and achieve your goal in a single conversation. Discussions or problems being presented to me in bits and pieces across multiple conversations is difficult for me to manage, and it can both frustrate me, and complicate my helping you resolve the situation.

How to help me
- I catch details in the moment, however I struggle to remember those details as I move forward. If you‚Äôre giving me a task, I‚Äôm writing all of this down so I can remember later. If I‚Äôm giving you a task, you need to write down these details as well, because I will forget them and not follow up later. I appreciate help making sure the details are covered. 
- Nudge me if I‚Äôm late for a meeting. I‚Äôm either 10 minutes early (as a way to compensate), or I‚Äôm 10 minutes late. I struggle to switch tracks in my mind when I‚Äôm working on something.
- Tell me what I need to know, not what you think I want to hear. The inconvenient truth is better than a softer omission or white lie.
- I am rarely, if ever, rude or offensive on purpose. If I have said or done something that you reacted to negatively, please tell me, because I am almost certainly not aware of the impact. I can't change my behaviour if I don't know how you feel.
- Sometimes I need someone to call me out on how my behaviour is being perceived. I am very strong in my convictions, so I frequently come across as dismissive or derisive of other people‚Äôs thoughts or opinions. This is not the case.
- Hanlon‚Äôs Razor: Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity (or in my case, ignorance).
- Be honest with me. It‚Äôs almost impossible for you to hurt my feelings, so don‚Äôt be afraid to speak your mind, as long as you do so politely.

What people misunderstand about me
- I am extremely direct in my communication. Sometimes people take my short, sharp communication to mean that I am angry or upset. I am simply trying to communicate in the most efficient way possible.
- I am an introvert, posing as a professional extrovert. I don‚Äôt like speaking publicly, but I force myself to, if necessary. Too much social contact can drain me significantly, and sometimes I need to be alone and recharge. Don‚Äôt confuse my tendency to work alone in my office with being disengaged.  My door is not always open, but you are always welcome to knock.
- I don‚Äôt need something to be my way; I need something to be the best way. I speak with a lot of conviction, which can intimidate people, but I‚Äôm not set in my thinking. I'm open-minded and always delighted to be shown a better way.
- I am not completely heartless. I just have a distinct barrier to displaying my empathy and care for people. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt care, it‚Äôs just not me who‚Äôs going to give you a big hug by default or be a physical shoulder to cry on. Displays of emotion make me uncomfortable.

What to do when I‚Äôm angry
- Please try to be patient with me, and try multiple different ways of exchanging ideas. If you‚Äôve exhausted all avenues, suggest that we shelve the discussion for the time being, and revisit later, as this can allow me time to ponder the information you‚Äôve provided me. Many times when anger comes on, it‚Äôs from exasperation. 
- Give me the hard truths. Though I can be very reactive, it‚Äôs important for me to understand that my actions have real consequences and could take me to places I don‚Äôt want to see. The truth of my behaviour can help me socially as well. It might show me how I look to my peers, or how I might hurt others‚Äô feelings by my negative actions.
- While no one likes negativity or anger, I invite you to take ownership of, and solve the root cause of the problem if it‚Äôs within your ability/responsibility.

Main points to remember
- I try to do the best, and be the best at everything I attempt. This means that if you‚Äôve had a less than positive experience with me, it was most certainly unintentional, and something I want to improve upon. You just need to let me know.
- I‚Äôm a person, a direct report, a teammate, a boss, and a messy work-in-progress. I‚Äôm committed to always getting better at my job, and to become a wiser, kinder and more impactful person.
